# <p align="center">Automatically Log-In on a Wi-Fi network in Safe Mode with Networking</p>
## Why is there a need for something like this?
Well, apparently Microsoft never treated this as a bug. It was treated as a FAD (Functioning As Designed)... and it still is. So, basically, the problem is this. When you're in Safe Mode with Networking in Windows, the OS doesn't automatically connect you with the last Wi-Fi network you were connected to while the OS was booted in regular mode. You have to manually connect to a network. Not only that, but Windows will moan that it can't connect to that network, but in fact it's already connected to it (if you manually choose to connect to it).

Well...
